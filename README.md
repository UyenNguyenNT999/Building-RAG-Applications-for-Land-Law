This project explores two approaches to enhance a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model and compare the hallucination in large language models (LLMs) like VinaLLama and LLama-2 for Vietnamese Land Law. The first approach involves using VinaLlama with mpnet for multilingual embeddings, enabling the model to accurately retrieve and generate contextually relevant information. The second approach uses Llama2 with the NLLB translation model to improve the retrieval and integration of data, ensuring precise and reliable outputs by leveraging comprehensive translation capabilities.
